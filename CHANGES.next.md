### Breaking changes:

-   The core_os os_type was removed from the Azure provider as
    [the image was deleted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros#supported-distributions-and-versions),
    -   It will be replaced by
        [Fedora Core OS](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/provisioning-azure/)
        if a public image is made avaiable.
-   The `dpb_sparksql_benchmark` now requires passing the requested queries with
    `--dpb_sparksql_query_order`
-   AwsVirtualMachine.IMAGE_OWNER has been changed from a string to a list of
    strings to support images which have multiple owners e.g. AmazonLinux2 in
    opt-in regions.
-   Remove Ubuntu1710 from `--os_types`.
-   Remove Amazon Linux 1 from `--os_types`.
-   Changed redis_memtier_benchmark to use redis version 6 and above. Redis
    versions less than 6 are no longer supported.
-   Make Ubuntu 18 the default os_type.
-   Deprecate Ubuntu 16 as it is EOL on 2021-05-01.
