### Breaking changes:
- Replaced gflags with absl-py. (GH-1518)
- Renamed GPU-related flags like so (old_flag_value -> new_flag_value):
  - gce_gpu_count -> gpu_count
  - gce_gpu_type -> gpu_type
- Replaced object_storage_objects_written_file* flags with prefix versions.
- Renamed tf_version flag to tf_pip_package flag to allow the user to specify
  the full tensorflow pip package name to be installed, instead of just being
  able to control the version.
- Changed default Tensorflow package when using CPUs to an Intel CPU-optimized
  build.
- Renamed cuda_toolkit_8 to cuda_toolkit

### New features:
- Windows benchmarks can now be run from linux controllers
- MXNet benchmarks can now be run from linux controllers
- Added initial support for preprovisioning benchmark binaries in the cloud.
- YCSB benchmark for Cloud Redis in GCP and Elasticache Redis in AWS
- Added a flag, `run_stage_iterations`, which causes a benchmark's run stage to be
  called a specified number of times
- Added cuda_toolkit_version flag
- Added support for CUDA Toolkit 9.0
- Added MXNet support for CUDA Toolkit 9.0
- Added new version of HPCG, with CUDA 9 support

- Make it easier to RDP to PKB VMs
- Avoid setting up thread pool etc when run_processes is set
  to 1 to simplify debugging using --run_with_pdb flag
- Added a sample benchmark for descriptive purposes.
- Added GPU peer to peer topology information to metadata.
- Added a flag, `hpcg_run_as_root` which allows OpenMPI to run HPCG in the case
  that the user is root.
- Modified KubernetesVirtualMachine to ensure that ssh is installed on the
  container.
- Added `container_cluster_num_vms` flag.
- Added the cluster's worker shape and worker count into the dpb service metadata.
- Added `azure_accelerated_networking` flag for Azure SR-IOV support.
- Added support for V100 GPUs on GCP.
- Add support for distributed TensorFlow benchmark.
- Added Azure Relational DB support for Postgres 9.6.
- Added `copy_benchmark_single_file_mb` flag for single file support.
- Record guest system information.
- Support for static edw clusters.
- Add more granularity to FAILED benchmarks with FailedSubstatus (GCP and AWS).
- Update sysbench benchmark to version 1.0. (deprecate 0.4 and 0.5 versions)
- Change GCP TPU command from alpha to beta.
