### Breaking changes:

-   The core_os os_type was removed from the Azure provider as
    [the image was deleted](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/endorsed-distros#supported-distributions-and-versions),
    -   It will be replaced by
        [Fedora Core OS](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/provisioning-azure/)
        if a public image is made avaiable.
