# README

`zip.py` bundles PerfKit Benchmarker into a python-executable zip file. This is
not a self-contained executable. Set-up steps must have already been performed
on the machine executing the generated zip file, including installation of
required packages and provider-specific CLI tools.

Usage:
`python tools/zip/zip.py <outfile>`
