New features of note:
Resource tagging -
* Add a "user" tag defaulting to the logged in user name to GCE and EC2 VMs.

Fixes:
* VMs, Networks, and disks now inherit from resource.BaseResource for uniform resource lifecycle management.
* Update object_storage_benchmark match latest CLI from all providers; retrieve credentials file from default location for each cloud provider.
* Add __setstate__ and __getstate__ methods so that pickling of GCE and AWS firewalls works again

* Fixed iperf parsing regex results
* Cleaned up versioning - Checked out specific versions from git in the MongoDB, OpenBLAS, Redis, and storage benchmarks.
* Fixed corner cases in SPEC 2006 causing it to fail on large instances.

# v0.1
