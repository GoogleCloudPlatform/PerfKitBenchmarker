"""Module containing mixin classes for package management.

These classes allow installation on both Debian and RHEL based linuxes.
They also handle some intial setup (especially on RHEL based linuxes
since by default sudo commands without a tty don't work) and
can restore the VM to the state it was in before packages were
installed.

To install a package on a VM, just call vm.Install(package_name).
The package name is just the name of the package module (i.e. the
file name minus .py). The framework will take care of all cleanup
for you.
