"""Contains package imports and a dictionary of package names and modules.

All modules within this package are considered packages, and are loaded
dynamically. Add non-package code to other packages.

Packages should, at a minimum, define install functions for each type of
package manager (e.g. YumInstall(vm) and AptInstall(vm)).
They may also define functions that return the path to a configuration file
(e.g. AptGetPathToConfig(vm)) and functions that return the linux service
name (e.g. YumGetServiceName(vm)). If the package only installs
packages through the package manager or places files in the temp directory
on the VM (vm_util.VM_TMP_DIR), then it does not need to define an uninstall
function. If the package manually places files in other locations
(e.g. /user/bin), then it also needs to define uninstall functions
(e.g. YumUninstall(vm)).

All functions in each package module should be prefixed with the type of package
manager, and all functions should accept a BaseVirtualMachine object as their
only arguments.

See perfkitbenchmarker/package_managers.py for more information on how to use
packages in benchmarks.
