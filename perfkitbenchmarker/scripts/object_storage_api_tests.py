  """ A benchmark test to measure list-after-write consistency. It uploads
  a large number of 1-byte objects in a short amount of time, and then issues
  a list request. If the first list request returns all objects as expected,
  then the result is deemed consistent. Otherwise, it keeps issuing list request
  until all expected objects are returned, and the test reports the time
  it takes from the end of the last write to the time the list returns
  consistent result.

  Args:
    storage_schema: The schema of the storage provider to use, e.g., "gs"
    host_to_connect: An optional host endpoint to connect to.

  Returns:
    A dictionary that contains the test results:
      'is-list-consistent': True/False
      'list-latency': if list is consistent, what is its latency
      'inconsistency-window': if list is inconsistent, how long did it take to
          reach consistency.

  Raises:
    LowAvailabilityError: when the storage provider has failed a high number of
        our RW requests that exceeds a threshold (>5%), we raise this error
        instead of collecting performance numbers from this run.
