# This script drives launch_my_sql service which is a wrapper class for
# mysql_service_benchmark. 
# Driver provisions a new instance approximately every three days.
# The run phase is completed several times daily with results uploaded to
# a designated cloud storage bucket.

# The values below are provisioned for realistic benchmarking.

# This script is designed for benchmarking purposes. Therefore, a value for
# a Google Cloud Storage Bucket must be passed in when called.

# Example call:
#    ./perfkitbenchmarker/scripts/database_scripts/launch_driver.sh bucket_name
