"""Benchmarking support for Apache Spark services.

In order to benchmark Apache Spark services such as Google Cloud
Platform's Dataproc or Amazon's EMR, we create a BaseSparkService
class.  Classes to wrap each provider's Apache Spark Service are
in the provider directory as a subclass of BaseSparkService.

Also in this module is a PkbSparkService, which builds a Spark
cluster by creating VMs and installing the necessary software.
