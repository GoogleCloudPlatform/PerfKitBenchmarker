"""Module containing AWS credential file installation and cleanup helpers.

AWS credentials consist of a secret access key and its ID, stored in a single
file. Following PKB's AWS setup instructions (see
https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker#install-aws-cli-and-setup-authentication),
the default location of the file will be at ~/.aws/credentials

This package copies the credentials file to the remote VM to make them available
for calls from the VM to other AWS services, such as SQS or Kinesis.
