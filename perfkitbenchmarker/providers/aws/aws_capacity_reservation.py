"""CapacityReservation for AWS virtual machines.

AWS EC2 has the concept of capacity reservations which allow the
user to request a reservation for a given number of VMs of a
specified shape (machine type and os type) in a given zone, for
an optionally-supplied duration. This module implements this functionaly.

A useful feature of using AwsCapacityReservation is that it allows the
user to specify a region instead of a zone, and this module will automatically
pick a zone that has capacity, and the VM(s) will then be launched in that zone.

AwsCapacityReservation modifies all the VMs in a given vm_group in the
following way:
  1. The capacity_reservation_id attribute on the VM is set after the
     reservation is created. The VM needs to reference this id during
     creation.
  2. If the user supplied a region instead of zone, then this module
     will update the zone attribute on the VM, as well as the zone
     attribute on the VM's network instance.

A run of PKB may have several capacity reservations; there is a 1:1 mapping
from AWS vm_groups to AwsCapacityReservation instances. This is because all
VMs in a VM group share the same shape and zone.
