"""Managed relational database provisioning for GCP.

As of June 2017 to make this benchmark run for GCP you must install the
gcloud beta component. This is necessary because creating a Cloud SQL instance
with a non-default storage size is in beta right now. This can be removed when
this feature is part of the default components.
See https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/beta/sql/instances/create
for more information.
To run this benchmark for GCP it is required to install a non-default gcloud
component. Otherwise this benchmark will fail.
To ensure that gcloud beta is installed, type
        'gcloud components list'
into the terminal. This will output all components and status of each.
Make sure that
  name: gcloud Beta Commands
  id:  beta
has status: Installed.
If not, run
        'gcloud components install beta'
to install it. This will allow this benchmark to properly create an instance.
