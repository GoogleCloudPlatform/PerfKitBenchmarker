## Overview

### Performance benchmarking

For most users, performance benchmarking is a series of steps in pursuit of an
answer to a performance question.
![benchmarking process](img/benchmarking_process.png "Benchmarking Process")

### Performance benchmarking on public cloud

Challenges often arise in selecting appropriate benchmarks, configuring
nontrivial environments, achieving consistent results, and sifting through
results for actionable intelligence and reporting.

Conducting performance benchmarking in public cloud adds layers to the
challenge. Experiments need to provision resources in cloud, navigate security
protections by adjusting firewall rules, and eventually deprovision resources
for cost efficiency.

[PerfKit Benchmarker](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker)
was created to aid benchmark selection, execution, and analysis using public
cloud resources.

### Introducing PerfKit Benchmarker

PerfKit Benchmarker is an open source framework with commonly accepted
benchmarking tools that you can use to measure and compare cloud providers. PKB
automates setup and teardown of resources, including Virtual Machines (VMs), on
whichever cloud provider you choose. Additionally, PKB installs and runs the
benchmark software tests and provides patterns for saving the test output for
future analysis and debugging.

#### PKB Architecture

PKB divides benchmarking experiments into a multi-step process:

__Configuration > Provisioning > Execution > Teardown > Publish__

![pkb architecture](img/pkb_architecture.png "PKB Architecture")

PKB meets most of the needs of any end-to-end performance benchmarking project.

Performance Benchmarking Process | PKB Architecture Stage
-------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
1. Identify criteria/problem     | Configuration
2. Choose benchmark              | Configuration
3. Execute benchmark tests       | Provisioning, Execution, Teardown
4. Analyze test data             | Publish

## Prerequisites

*   Basic familiarity with Linux command line
*   Basic familiarity with Google Cloud

## Set up

### What you'll need

To complete this lab, you'll need:

*   Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended), where
    you can access the Cloud Console and the Cloud Shell
*   A Google Cloud project

### Sign in to Cloud Console

In your browser, open the [Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com).

Select your project using the project selector dropdown at the top of page.

### Activate the Cloud Shell

From the Cloud Console click the __Activate Cloud Shell__ icon on the top right
toolbar:

![alt text](img/cloud_shell_icon.png "Cloud Shell Icon")

You may need to click __Continue__ the first time.

It should only take a few moments to provision and connect to your Cloud Shell
environment.

This Cloud Shell virtual machine is loaded with all the development tools you'll
need. It offers a persistent 5GB home directory, and runs on Google Cloud,
greatly enhancing network performance and authentication. All of your work in
this lab can be done within a browser on your Google Chromebook.

Once connected to the Cloud Shell, you can verify your setup.

1.  Check that you're already authenticated.

    ```
    gcloud auth list
    ```

    **Expected output**

    ```
     Credentialed accounts:
    ACTIVE  ACCOUNT
    *       <myaccount>@<mydomain>.com
    ```

    **Note:** `gcloud` is the powerful and unified command-line tool for Google
    Cloud. Full documentation is available from
    https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud. It comes pre-installed on Cloud Shell.
    Notice `gcloud` supports tab-completion.

1.  Verify your project is known.

    ```
    gcloud config list project
    ```

    **Expected output**

    ```
    [core]
    project = <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

    If it is not, you can set it with this command:

    ```
    gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
    ```

    **Expected output**

    ```
    Updated property [core/project].
    ```

### Disable OS Login, in favor of legacy SSH keys

[OS Login](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/oslogin/) is now enabled by
default on this project, and any VM instances created. OS Login enables the use
of Compute Engine IAM roles to manage SSH access to Linux instances.

PKB, however, uses legacy SSH keys for authentication, so OS Login must be
disabled.

In Cloud Shell, disable OS Login for the project.

```
gcloud compute project-info add-metadata --metadata enable-oslogin=FALSE
```

## Task 1. Install PerfKit Benchmarker

In this lab, you use Cloud Shell and the
[PKB repo in GitHub](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker).

1.  Set up a virtualenv isolated Python environment within Cloud Shell.

    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3-venv -y
    python3 -m venv $HOME/my_virtualenv
    ```

    ```
    source $HOME/my_virtualenv/bin/activate
    ```

1.  Ensure Google Cloud SDK tools like bq find the proper Python.

    ```
    export CLOUDSDK_PYTHON=$HOME/my_virtualenv/bin/python
    ```

1.  Clone the PerfKitBenchmarker repository.

    ```
    cd $HOME && git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker.git
    ```

    ```
    cd PerfKitBenchmarker/
    ```

1.  Install PKB dependencies.

    ```
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

> __Note__: As part of this lab, you will will run a few basic tests on Google
> Cloud within a simple PKB environment. Additional setup may be required to run
> benchmarks on other providers, or to run more complex benchmarks.
> Comprehensive instructions for running other benchmarks can be located by
> reviewing the
> [README in the PKB repo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker).

## Task 2. Start one benchmark test

The `--benchmarks` flag is used to select the benchmark(s) run.

Not supplying `--benchmarks` is the same as using `--benchmarks="standard_set"`,
which takes hours to run. The __standard_set__ is a collection of commonly used
benchmarks. You can read more about benchmark sets later in this lab.

Cloud benchmark tests commonly need at least 10 minutes to complete because of
the many resources, including networks, firewall rules, and VMs, that must be
both provisioned and de-provisioned.

__Start a benchmark test now, and then continue working through the lab while
the test executes.__

Run the commonly used network throughput test, __iperf__, with small machines:
__n1-standard-1__.

__Expected duration__: ~13-14min.

```
./pkb.py --benchmarks=iperf
```

> __Note__: while the `iperf` test is running, continue through both _Task 3_,
> and _Task 4_.

When the benchmark run completes, expected output will include four throughput
numbers, from four 60s runs:

*   traffic over __external IPs__, vm1>vm2
*   traffic over __internal IPs__, vm1>vm2
*   traffic over __external IPs__, vm2>vm1
*   traffic over __internal IPs__, vm2>vm1

## Task 3. Explore PKB command-line flags

You could run benchmark tests right now with no other set up required.

__Don't do this just yet__, but if you execute `./pkb.py` with no command-line
flags, PKB will attempt to run a __standard__ set of benchmarks on __default__
machine types in the __default__ region. Running this set takes hours. You can
read more about the __standard_set__ later in this lab.

Instead, it is more common to choose specific benchmarks and options using
__command-line flags__.

### The project, cloud provider, zone, and machine_type flags

You should understand how the `--cloud` provider, `--project`, `--zone`, and
`--machine_type` flags work.

*   `--cloud`: As __Google Cloud__ is the default cloud provider for PKB, the
    `--cloud` flag has a default value of __GCP__.
*   `--project`: PKB needs to have a Google Cloud __PROJECT-ID__ to manage
    resources and run benchmarks. When using Cloud Shell in this lab, PKB infers
    the `--project` from the environment __PROJECT-ID__.
*   `--zone`: Every cloud provider has a default zone. For Google Cloud, the
    `--zone` flag
    [defaults](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/blob/master/perfkitbenchmarker/configs/default_config_constants.yaml)
    to `us-central1-a`.
*   `--machine_type`: Benchmarks are frequently tightly coupled to specific
    machine capabilities, especially CPU and memory. You can pick your specific
    machines with the `--machine_type` flag. Most benchmark tests, including the
    common networking benchmarks __ping__, __iperf__, and __netperf__, default
    to the provider-specific `default_single_core` machine. On Google Cloud, the
    [default machine](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/blob/master/perfkitbenchmarker/configs/default_config_constants.yaml)
    is the `n1-standard-1`.

You can learn more about alternative flag values in the
[Useful Global Flags](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker#useful-global-flags)
section of the PKB readme.

### Discovering helfpul flags and notes about benchmark tests

While __iperf__ is running, explore PKB benchmarks and flags.

1.  Open a second Cloud Shell session.

    Click the __Open a new tab__ button on top of the existing Cloud Shell to
    open a second Cloud Shell session.

    ![add cloudshell](img/add_cloudshell.png "Add Cloud Shell")

1.  Activate virtualenv in this session.

    ```
    source $HOME/my_virtualenv/bin/activate
    ```

1.  Change to the PerfKitBenchmarker directory.

    ```
    cd $HOME/PerfKitBenchmarker
    ```

1.  Review all the global flags for PKB.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --helpmatch=pkb
    ```

    PKB includes the `--helpmatch` flag which can be used to discover details
    about benchmarks and related configuration flags. You can pass `--helpmatch`
    a regex and it will print related help text.

1.  Review the full list of benchmarks available.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --helpmatch=benchmarks | grep perfkitbenchmarker
    ./pkb.py --helpmatch=benchmarks | grep perfkitbenchmarker | wc -l
    ```

    The `--benchmarks` flag, you used it previously, selects a specific
    benchmark or benchmark set.

    You should see around 80 different benchmarks available to run, within the
    linux_benchmarks and windows_benchmarks collections.

    PKB has a naming convention for benchmarks of
    __[COLLECTION]\_benchmarks.[NAME]\_benchmark__. For example:

    ```
    linux_benchmarks.ping_benchmark
    linux_benchmarks.iperf_benchmark
    linux_benchmarks.netperf_benchmark
    ```

1.  Review the available Linux benchmarks using --helpmatchmd.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --helpmatchmd=linux_benchmarks
    ```

    When you want to review the details and flags of a benchmark in depth, it
    can be easier to read formatted __MarkDown__. The `--helpmatchmd` flag emits
    more easily readable MarkDown text than `--helpmatch`.

    You can use `more` to view the results page by page.

1.  Review the flags for the netperf benchmark.

    Each benchmark, such as __netperf__, can have custom flags too.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --helpmatchmd=netperf
    ```

You can __exit__ the second Cloud Shell session now.

## Task 4. Consider different network benchmarks

PerfKitBenchmarker includes 3 widely used __networking__ benchmarks: __ping__,
__iperf__, and __netperf__. Each of these network tests can be useful in
different situations. Below is a short summary of each of these benchmarks.

### ping

The __ping__ command is the most widely distributed and is commonly used to
verify connectivity and measure simple network latency. It measures the round
trip time (rtt) of ICMP packets.

### iperf

The __iperf__ tool is easy to use and is used to measure network throughput
using TCP or UDP streams. It supports multiple threads streaming data
simultaneously. It has a variety of parameters that can be set to test and
maximize throughput.

### netperf

The __netperf__ tool contains several different test types. You can use
__TCP_RR__, TCP request-response, to test network latency. You can run
__TCP_STREAM__ to test network throughput.

You can run multiple instances of netperf in parallel to heavily stress links
via multiple processors. The netperf tool also supports running UDP latency and
throughput tests.

With netperf, you can also see alternative reporting flavors with its data
histograms.

In many cases, it is recommended to run combinations of all three networking
benchmark tools and use the additional test result data to confirm your
findings.

## Task 5. Explore the results of a benchmark test

The __iperf__ test you started, should now be completed. Return to the first
Cloud Shell session to review the test results from __iperf__.

Detailed output from benchmark execution is printed to the terminal, and saved
to log files under `/tmp/perfkitbenchmarker/runs/`.

Whether you scroll back in the Cloud Shell, or look through the `pkb.log` file,
you can review many details about the benchmark pass:

*   __PKB details__: version# and flags used.
*   __Resources being provisioned__: an auto-mode VPC network, two firewall
    rules, one for internal IPs and another for external IPs, two VM instances,
    and attached persistent-disks.
*   __Software setup__: Setup directories on both VMs, installations of python,
    iperf, and other packages.
*   __System configuration__: adjustments to kernel settings, including
    `tcp_congestion_control`.
*   __Test execution__: this __iperf__ benchmark runs 4 different tests:
    *   VM1->VM2 throughput test over __external__ IPs
    *   VM1->VM2 throughput test over __internal__ IPs
    *   VM2->VM1 throughput test over __external__ IPs
    *   VM2->VM1 throughput test over __internal__ IPs
*   __Resources being cleaned up__: deprovision the resources created earlier.
*   __Detailed result data__:
    *   Detailed metadata describing the resources allocated.
    *   Metrics: including timestamp, units, and values for measurements.
*   __Results Summary__: an easy-to-read table with the key metrics and values.
*   __Overall test status__: especially useful when multiple benchmarks have
    run.

## Task 6. Run more benchmark tests using PerfKit Benchmarker

When you have time, later, run a few more networking benchmarks. Explore the log
output, and results summaries carefully. Consider adjusting flags for the
benchmarks by looking through the `--helpmatchmd` output.

### [Optional] Measure TCP latency and throughput with netperf

1.  Run a test to determine the TCP latency and throughput between two machines
    in a single zone.

    > __Note__: as of 2020, the __netperf__ benchmark runs
    > [netperf v2.7.0](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/blob/master/perfkitbenchmarker/linux_packages/netperf.py)
    > customized by some PKB-specific patches.

    __Expected duration__: ~16-20min.

    > The __netperf__ benchmark takes a little longer than __iperf__ because the
    > binaries are compiled on the VMs, and the VMs are rebooted to apply
    > kernel/system configuration changes.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --benchmarks=netperf --netperf_benchmarks="TCP_RR,TCP_STREAM"
    ```

### [Optional] Measure UDP latency and throughput with netperf

1.  Run a test to determine the UDP latency and throughput between two machines
    in a single zone.

    > __Note__: as of 2020, the __netperf__ benchmark runs
    > [netperf v2.7.0](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/blob/master/perfkitbenchmarker/linux_packages/netperf.py)
    > customized by some PKB-specific patches.

    __Expected duration__: ~16-20min.

    > The __netperf__ benchmark takes a little longer than __iperf__ because the
    > binaries are compiled on the VMs, and the VMs are rebooted to apply
    > kernel/system configuration changes.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --benchmarks=netperf --netperf_benchmarks="UDP_RR,UDP_STREAM"

    *   For general documentation on these metrics, see the
        [Netperf manual](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/netperf/doc/netperf.html).

### [Optional] Measure latency with ping

Run a test to determine the latency between two machines in a single zone.

__Expected duration__: ~11-12min.

Select the machine_type:

```
./pkb.py --benchmarks=ping --machine_type=f1-micro
```

Or, select the zone:

```
./pkb.py --benchmarks=ping --zone=us-east1-b
```

Or, both:

```
./pkb.py --benchmarks=ping --zone=us-east1-b --machine_type=f1-micro
```

### [Optional] Verify 32 Gbps egress bandwidth for same-zone VM-to-VM traffic with netperf

Google Cloud supports 32 Gbps network egress bandwidth using
[__Skylake__](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types) or later CPU
platforms.

> __Note:__ this experiment requires 2 VMs with 16 vCPUs. You may be
> restricted from running this experiment in Qwiklabs due to resource caps.
> Tests with many vCPUs and significant egress will be more __costly__.

1.  Run __netperf__ to verify max throughput between two machines in a single
    zone.

    __Expected duration__: ~12-15min.

    ```
    ./pkb.py --benchmarks=netperf --zone=us-central1-b \
        --machine_type=n1-standard-16 --gcp_min_cpu_platform=skylake \

    ...
    ```

    Notice that traffic traversing between VMs over __external IPs__ cannot
    achieve the same throughput as when using __internal IPs__ between VMs.

1.  Consider the `--netperf_num_streams` argument.

    In order to maximize probable throughput, the test must use many
    threads/streams. The precise number of threads/streams required varies.
    Factors affecting the variation include the current congestion in the
    network fabric between VMs, and the details of the underlying
    hardware/software environment.

1.  Consider the `--netperf_test_length` argument.

    Per stream variation is usually narrowed by running the tests with longer
    runtimes than the default `60s`.

1.  View __pkb.log__ and explore the results, for more details on streams.

    Retrieve the path to your __pkb.log__ file, which is printed at the very end
    of your test pass.

        [Netperf Homepage](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/netperf/).
    *   For details on per-thread/stream performance, search on
        `Throughput_average`. You can see that each thread/stream throughput
        experiences great variation. It's common to see threads/streams with
        throughput ranging from 2 Gbps upto 6 Gbps, when using __internal__ IP
        addresses.

    > __Note__: this is not necessarily the range or limit for a single
    > stream. If your interest is in single-stream performance, then you
    > should run single-stream tests.

## Task 7. Understand custom configuration files and benchmark sets

### Customizing benchmarks with custom configuration files

The easiest way to run networking benchmarks between two specific zones, with
specific flags, is to use __benchmark configuration files__.

Create a sample benchmark config file:

```
cat << EOF > ./sample_config.yml
iperf:
  vm_groups:
    vm_1:
      cloud: GCP
      vm_spec:
        GCP:
          machine_type: n1-standard-2
          zone: us-central1-b
    vm_2:
      cloud: GCP
      vm_spec:
        GCP:
          machine_type: n1-standard-2
          zone: us-east1-b
flags:
  iperf_sending_thread_count: 5
  iperf_runtime_in_seconds: 30
EOF
```

This configuration file runs __iperf__ between a VM in zone `us-central1-b` and
a VM in zone `us-east1-b`, with 5 sending threads, with 2 vCPU machines, for 30
seconds each.

You can set the cloud provider, zone, machine type, and many other options for
each VM in the config file.

When you have time later, run this benchmark by creating and using the config
file.

__Expected duration__: 10-11min.

```
./pkb.py --benchmark_config_file=./sample_config.yml --benchmarks=iperf
```

__Note__: even though the config file includes the benchmark name, you must
still supply the `--benchmarks` flag.

__Output (do not copy)__

```output
-------------------------PerfKitBenchmarker Results Summary-------------------------
...
IPERF:
  Throughput                         3606.000000 Mbits/sec
(ip_type="external" receiving_machine_type="n1-standard-2" ...
  Throughput                         3667.000000 Mbits/sec
(ip_type="internal" receiving_machine_type="n1-standard-2" ...
  Throughput                         3564.000000 Mbits/sec
(ip_type="external" receiving_machine_type="n1-standard-2" ...
  Throughput                         3700.000000 Mbits/sec
(ip_type="internal" receiving_machine_type="n1-standard-2" ...
...
------------------------------------------
Name   UID     Status     Failed Substatus
------------------------------------------
iperf  iperf0  SUCCEEDED
------------------------------------------
Success rate: 100.00% (1/1)
...
```

By default, config files must reside under the
`PerfKitBenchmarker/perfkitbenchmarker/configs/` directory.

You can also specify the full path to the config file, as instructed earlier.

```
./pkb.py --benchmark_config_file=/path/to/config/file.yml --benchmarks=iperf
```

### Understanding Benchmark Sets

PKB defines curated collections of benchmark tests called __benchmark sets__.
These sets are defined in the `perfkitbenchmarker/benchmark_sets.py`
[file](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitBenchmarker/blob/master/perfkitbenchmarker/benchmark_sets.py).

Sets include:

*   __standard_set__: commonly agreed upon set of cloud performance benchmarks.
*   __google_set__: slightly longer collection of benchmarks than
    standard_set. Includes `tensorflow` benchmarks.
*   __kubernetes_set__: collection of tests intended to run on Kubernetes
    clusters. Requires specialized setup at this time.
*   __cloudsuite_set__: collection of cloudsuite_XXX benchmarks.

Other sets are defined as well.

You can also run multiple benchmarks by using a comma separated list with the
`--benchmarks` flag.

## Task 8. Push test result data to BigQuery

By default PKB will output results to the terminal and save logs to the
directory `/tmp/perfkitbenchmarker/runs/`.

A recommended practice is to push your result data to
[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/), a serverless, highly-scalable,
cost-effective data warehouse. You can then use BigQuery to review your test
results over time, and create data visualizations.

### Populate BigQuery dataset with sample data

To quickly experiment with BigQuery, load sample test data.

1.  Initialize an empty __dataset__ where result tables and views can be
    created, secured and shared.

    For this lab, use the BigQuery command-line tool `bq` in Cloud Shell.

    Create a dataset for samples.

    ```
    bq mk samples_mart
    ```

    __Output (do not copy)__

    ```output
    Dataset '[PROJECT-ID]:samples_mart' successfully created.
    ```

    You can also create datasets using the BigQuery UI in the Cloud Console.

    __Note__: For this lab, use the BigQuery command-line tool `bq` in Cloud
    Shell.

1.  Load the `samples_mart` __dataset__ from a file.

    ```
    export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
    bq load --project_id=$PROJECT \
        --source_format=NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON \
        samples_mart.results \
        ./tutorials/beginner_walkthrough/data/samples_mart/sample_results.json \
        ./tutorials/beginner_walkthrough/data/samples_mart/results_table_schema.json
    ```

    __Output (do not copy)__

    ```output
    Upload complete.
    Waiting on bqjob_xxxx ... (1s) Current status: DONE
    ```

    > __Note:__ this data was prepared by the networking research team at the
    > [AT&T Center for Virtualization](https://www.smu.edu/Provost/virtualization)
    > at __Southern Methodist University__.

### Query sample data in BigQuery

You can see your data using the command-line `bq` tool, again, in Cloud Shell.

```
bq query 'SELECT * FROM samples_mart.results LIMIT 200'
```

You can also see your data using the
[BigQuery UI](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery).

Use the __Query editor__ to __Run__ a simple query that shows your results.

```
SELECT * FROM samples_mart.results LIMIT 200;
```

### Pushing Data to BigQuery with PKB

When you're ready to run benchmarks, or sets, and push your results to BigQuery,
you need to use special command-line flags.

1.  Create an empty dataset where result tables and views can be created,
    secured and shared.

    Use the BigQuery command-line tool `bq` in Cloud Shell.

    ```
    bq mk example_dataset
    ```

    __Output (do not copy)__

    ```output
    Dataset '[PROJECT-ID]:example_dataset' successfully created.
    ```

1.  Run a PKB experiment with BigQuery arguments - push the results to BigQuery.

    When you run PKB, supply the BigQuery-specific arguments to send your result
    data directly to BigQuery tables.

    *   `--bq_project`: your Google Cloud __PROJECT-ID__ that owns the dataset
        and tables.
    *   `--bigquery_table`: a fully qualified table name, including the dataset.
        The first time you run experiments, PKB will create the table if it does
        not yet exist.

    __Expected duration__: 13-14min.

    ```
    cd $HOME/PerfKitBenchmarker
    export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
    ./pkb.py --benchmarks=iperf \
        --bq_project=$PROJECT \
        --bigquery_table=example_dataset.network_tests
    ```

    ```

    You will learn to __visualize__ such data, in the next section.

## Task 9. Query and visualize result data with Data Studio

To really impact your business, though, you want to identify insights from your
performance projects. You need to look through many passes of multiple tests
over time. You may watch for unexpected spikes, variations over time, or
differences from one geography to another.

Visualization tools help you to summarize large sets of result data into
understandable charts, and tables.

__Data Studio__ is a Google tool for data visualization. It can dynamically pull
and display data from BiqQuery, and many other data sources.

With Data Studio, you can copy an existing sample __dashboard__, then customize
it to fit your requirements. You can also create dashboards from scratch. The
BigQuery tables with your PKB results become your __data sources__.

You can attach your dashboards to your data sources to easily view your
performance data and start to identify critical insights. Data Studio maintains
a complete version history, similar to _history_ in Google Docs.

### Review a running demo instance of Data Studio

First, look at an
[Example Datastudio Report](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/97043c2d-12ed-4d47-8b7b-4305f4b4aaed).

![Datastudio example report](img/datastudio_example.png "Datastudio example report")

You will clone this report, then add your own data.

First, you need a set of performance data to use in this example.

### Load a larger set of sample data to visualize

To demonstrate the capabilities of Data Studio, load a larger collection of demo
data.

1.  Create an empty dataset where result tables and views can be created,
    secured and shared.

    If you already did this earlier, skip to the next step.

    Use the BigQuery command-line tool `bq` in Cloud Shell.

    ```
    bq mk example_dataset
    ```

    __Output (do not copy)__

    ```output
    Dataset '[PROJECT-ID]:example_dataset' successfully created.
    ```

    If you see the following error, don't worry, you already created the
    BigQuery dataset.

    ```output
    BigQuery error in mk operation: Dataset 'example_dataset' already exists
    ```

1.  Load data from a json file to the `results` table in `example_dataset`.

    The --autodetect flag is used to autodetect the table schema. The table need
    not exist before running the command.

    ```
    export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
    bq load --project_id=$PROJECT \
        --autodetect \
        --source_format=NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON \
        example_dataset.results \
        ./tutorials/beginner_walkthrough/data/bq_pkb_sample.json
    ```

    __Output (do not copy)__

    ```output
    Upload complete.
    Waiting on bqjob_xxxx ... (1s) Current status: DONE
    ```

### Create a dataset view

Dataset views make reading and writing SQL queries simpler.

1.  Create a file with the SQL command for defining the view.

    ```
    cat << EOF > ./results_view.sql
    SELECT
        value,
        unit,
        metric,
        test,
        TIMESTAMP_MICROS(CAST(timestamp * 1000000 AS int64)) AS thedate,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|vm_1_cloud:(.*?)\|") AS vm_1_cloud,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|vm_2_cloud:(.*?)\|") AS vm_2_cloud,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|sending_zone:(.*?)\|") AS sending_zone,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|receiving_zone:(.*?)\|") AS receiving_zone,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|sending_zone:(.*?-.*?)-.*?\|") AS sending_region,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|receiving_zone:(.*?-.*?)-.*?\|") AS receiving_region,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|vm_1_machine_type:(.*?)\|") AS machine_type,
        REGEXP_EXTRACT(labels, r"\|ip_type:(.*?)\|") AS ip_type
    FROM
       \`$PROJECT.example_dataset.results\`
    EOF
    ```

1.  Create a new dataset view using the SQL file.

    ```
    export PROJECT=$(gcloud info --format='value(config.project)')
    bq mk \
    --use_legacy_sql=false \
    --description '"This is my view"' \
    --view "$(cat ./results_view.sql)" \
    example_dataset.results_view
    ```

    __Output (do not copy)__

    ```output
    View '[project_id]:example_dataset.results_view' successfully created.
    ```

    This __dataset view__ `example_dataset.results_view` will be used as a data
    source in the Data Studio Report.

### Prepare a Data Studio Report

1.  Clone the
    [Example Datastudio Report](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/97043c2d-12ed-4d47-8b7b-4305f4b4aaed).

    Load the report, and click the __Make a Copy of This Report__ button, near
    the top-right.

    ![Copy report](img/copy_report.png "Copy Report")

    __Note:__ You may be asked to allow Data Studio access to Drive to save your
    reports. Click __Allow__.

    Your report copy looks just like the example, except it uses your data from
    BigQuery, through your Data Source.

    ![Copy of Report](img/copy_of_report.png "Copy of Report")

1.  Explore the report options. Change layout, or theme options.

    Try adding new charts, using the new data source. Data Studio offers
    different chart types and options to visualize many different metrics,
    related to performance benchmarks.

    Click __View__. Click __Edit__ to edit again.

Enjoy.
